# WebScraper

Tried out how to make a web scraper and scrape multiple websites simultaneously.

You can enter more links and more number of articles will be scraped but the maximum number is 60 at once so you can make multiple files containing the URLs in a set of 60.

I have pasted a part of the output in the Output.txt file, you can check out the image (scraper.png) which will show it in working.
